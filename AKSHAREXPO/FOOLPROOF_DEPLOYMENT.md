## üìä EXPECTED RESPONSE:

### ‚úÖ **SUCCESS (Script Working):**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Referral shared via whatsapp! You earned 3 coins. Share unlimited times to earn more!",
  "actionType": "share",
  "coinsEarned": 3,
  "totalCoins": 3,
  "referralCount": 0,
  "platformsShared": ["whatsapp"],
  "platformShareCounts": {"whatsapp": 1}
}
```

**If you see this:**

---

### ‚ùå **FAILURE (Still Not Working):**
```json

  "received_parameters": {}
}
```

**If you see this:**

- ‚ùå Wrong URL being used

**Solution:** Try creating deployment again, or check if code has the updates.

---

### ‚ùå **ERROR Response:**
```json
{
  "error": "ReferenceError: setTimeout is not defined"
}
```

**If you see this:**

## üéØ Why Fresh Deployment Works:

### **Problem with Editing:**
- Editing deployments sometimes doesn't activate new code
- Google Apps Script caches old versions
- "New version" doesn't always work

### **Solution with Fresh Deployment:**
- Archiving old deployments clears cache
- Creating new deployment forces fresh start
- New URL gets new cache entry
- Guaranteed to use updated code
