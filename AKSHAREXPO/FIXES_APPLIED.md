# ✅ ALL FIXES APPLIED

## 🔴 Problems Fixed:

### 1. ❌ Frontend showing 3 coins instead of 6 for 2 shares
**Fixed:** Frontend now calculates coins from actual share count:
```javascript
// OLD: Used first record's totalCoins (could be stale)
const totalCoins = firstRecord.totalCoins || 0;

// NEW: Calculates from actual share count
const totalCoins = (totalSharesFromSheets * 3) + (referralCount * 1);
```

### 2. ❌ Referrer Count not being stored in Google Sheets
**Fixed:** Added "Referrer Count" column to Google Sheets:
- Column N: "Referrer Count" (how many people registered via user's link)
- Frontend now sends `referralCount` and `totalReferrals` to Google Sheets
- Google Sheets script captures and returns this data

### 3. ❌ Google Sheets not showing all platforms
**Fixed:** Each share creates a separate row with the platform name:
- Every share = new row with platform (whatsapp, linkedin, email, etc.)
- Frontend aggregates platforms from all rows
- Google Sheets "Platform" column (column G) shows the platform for each share

## 🧪 How to Test:

### Test 1: Coins Calculation
```
1. Clear browser cache/localStorage
2. Login as a user
3. Share on WhatsApp → Confirm
   ✅ Should show: 3 coins, 1 share
4. Share on WhatsApp again → Confirm
   ✅ Should show: 6 coins, 2 shares (FIXED!)
5. Share on LinkedIn → Confirm
   ✅ Should show: 9 coins, 3 shares
```

### Test 2: Referrer Count in Google Sheets
```
1. Share multiple times
2. Open Google Sheets
3. Check column N "Referrer Count"
   ✅ Should show 0 (if no one registered yet)
4. Have someone register via your link
5. Share again
   ✅ Column N should show 1 (FIXED!)
```

### Test 3: All Platforms Shown
```
1. Share on WhatsApp (2 times)
2. Share on LinkedIn (1 time)
3. Share on Email (1 time)
4. Open Google Sheets

## 📊 Expected Google Sheets Structure:

After 2 WhatsApp shares + 1 LinkedIn share:

| Timestamp | Type | Email | Platform | Coins Earned | Total Coins | Total Shares | Referrer Count |
|-----------|------|-------|----------|--------------|-------------|--------------|----------------|
| 10:00 | share | test@email.com | whatsapp | 3 | 3 | 1 | 0 |
| 10:05 | share | test@email.com | whatsapp | 3 | 6 | 2 | 0 |
| 10:10 | share | test@email.com | linkedin | 3 | 9 | 3 | 0 |

**Key Points:**
- Each row = one share action
- Platform column shows which platform was used
- Total Coins = cumulative (3, 6, 9...)
- Referrer Count = how many registered via user's link (0 in this example)

## 🚀 Deployment Steps:

### Step 1: Update Google Apps Script
