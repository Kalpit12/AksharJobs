| 2025-10-03 10:00 | share | test@example.com | whatsapp | 3 | 3 | 1 | 1 |

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Issue: Still not seeing coins/shares in sheets
**Solution:**
1. Make sure you SAVED the script (Ctrl+S)
2. Make sure you DEPLOYED it (not just saved!)
3. Check you're using "Anyone" access
4. Verify SHEET_ID is correct

### Issue: Getting authorization errors
**Solution:**
1. Go through authorization again
2. Click "Advanced" ‚Üí "Go to... (unsafe)"
3. Click "Allow"

### Issue: Script timeout errors
**Solution:**
1. This is normal for Google Sheets
2. Data should still be saved
3. Check the sheet manually

### Issue: Duplicate entries
**Solution:**
1. This is expected! Each share creates a new row
2. Use "Total Coins" column for the user's actual total

## üìû Verify Deployment

Check these logs in your browser console:

### ‚úÖ Good:
```javascript
Sending referral data to Google Sheets: {
  type: "share",
  referrerEmail: "test@example.com",
  platform: "whatsapp",
  coinsEarned: 3,
  totalCoins: 3,
  totalShares: 1
}
‚úÖ Sent share data to Google Sheets for whatsapp
```

### ‚ùå Bad:
```javascript
‚ùå Error sending to Google Sheets
Failed to load resource: net::ERR_FAILED
```

## üéØ Critical Points

1. **MUST deploy as Web App** (not just save the script)
2. **MUST use "Anyone" access** (not "Only myself")
3. **MUST update SHEET_ID** in the script
4. **MUST authorize the script** when deploying
5. **Each share creates a NEW ROW** (not updating existing rows)

---

## ‚úÖ After Deployment

Your referral tracking will now properly capture:
- ‚úÖ Every share action
- ‚úÖ Coins earned per share
- ‚úÖ Total coins (cumulative)
- ‚úÖ Total shares count
- ‚úÖ Platform-specific share counts
- ‚úÖ Timestamps for all actions

**Deploy Time:** ~5 minutes
**Status:** CRITICAL - Must deploy to fix tracking!
