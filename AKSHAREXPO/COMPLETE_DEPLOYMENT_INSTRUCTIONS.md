https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbzEzInMtaTHux3dNtmcckpy2jfX-ywaDJflALkXtXgBRruelQOb5WbjonEPpgvFJ_bHyw/exec?type=share&action=referral_share&referrerEmail=test@example.com&referrerName=Test&referrerPhone=1234567890&referrerRole=job_seeker&platform=whatsapp&coinsEarned=3&totalCoins=3&totalShares=1&referralCount=0&shareId=verify123

4. Press Enter
5. You'll see JSON response in browser
```

---

### **STEP 6: Check the Response**

**‚úÖ GOOD Response (Script Working):**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Referral shared via whatsapp! You earned 3 coins. Share unlimited times to earn more!",
  "actionType": "share",
  "coinsEarned": 3,
  "totalCoins": 3,
  "referralCount": 0,
  "platformsShared": ["whatsapp"],
  "platformShareCounts": {"whatsapp": 1}
}
```

**‚úÖ What this means:**
- Script is processing data correctly
- Updated code is deployed
- Ready to test from referral page

---

**‚ùå BAD Response (Script NOT Working):**
```json
{
  "message": "AksharJobs Expo Registration & Referral API is running",
  "timestamp": "...",
  "received_parameters": {}
}
```

**‚ùå What this means:**
- Updated code NOT deployed yet
- Still using old version
- Need to repeat Step 4 (Deploy with "New version")

---

**OR**

**‚ùå ERROR Response:**
```json
{
  "error": "ReferenceError: setTimeout is not defined"
}
```

**‚ùå What this means:**
- Old code with setTimeout still deployed
- Need to paste NEW code and redeploy

---

### **STEP 7: Test from Referral Page**
```
1. After getting GOOD response from Step 6
2. Open referral.html
3. Clear cache: Ctrl+Shift+R
4. Clear localStorage (F12): localStorage.clear(); location.reload();
5. Login as Neel
6. Share on WhatsApp ‚Üí Confirm
7. Wait 10 seconds
8. Open Google Sheets ‚Üí Refresh
9. Check row for neel66569@gmail.com:
   - Share Count: 1
   - Akshar coins: 3 (NOT 6!)
10. Share again:
   - Share Count: 2
   - Akshar coins: 6 (NOT 12!)
```

## üéØ Critical Points:

1. **MUST click "New version"** - Not just "Deploy"
2. **MUST wait 30 seconds** - For deployment to activate
3. **MUST test with incognito** - To avoid cached responses
4. **Check Google Sheets** - To confirm data is correct

---

## üìû What to Tell Me:

After following all steps, paste here:
1. The JSON response you got from Step 6
2. Whether Google Sheets shows correct coins (3, 6, 9... not double)
