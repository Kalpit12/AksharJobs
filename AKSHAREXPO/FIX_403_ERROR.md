## üéì Understanding the Error:

### **What 403 Means:**
```
403 = Forbidden = You don't have permission
```

### **Why It Happens:**
Google Apps Script has security settings. When deployed with "Only myself" access:
- ‚úÖ You can access it (when logged into your Google account)
- ‚ùå Your website CANNOT access it
- ‚ùå Anonymous users CANNOT access it

### **The Fix:**
Change to "Anyone" access:
- ‚úÖ Anyone can send data to the script
- ‚úÖ Your website can access it
- ‚úÖ All users can share and track data

---

## üöÄ After Fixing:

### **Console Logs Should Show:**
```javascript
‚úÖ Fetch sent to Google Sheets (no-cors)
‚úÖ Image pixel loaded successfully
‚úÖ Iframe loaded successfully
```

### **NOT:**
```javascript
‚ùå Failed to load resource: 403
‚ö†Ô∏è Referral image pixel error
```

4. Click ‚úèÔ∏è (Edit icon)
