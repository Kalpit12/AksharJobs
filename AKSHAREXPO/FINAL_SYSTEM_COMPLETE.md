## 🧮 Coin Calculation Formula

### Frontend Calculates:
```javascript
totalShares = whatsappShares + linkedinShares + emailShares + twitterShares + ...
totalReferrals = count from Google Sheets (Referral_Clicks)

coinsFromShares = totalShares × 3
coinsFromReferrals = totalReferrals × 1

TOTAL COINS = coinsFromShares + coinsFromReferrals
```

### Example: Shefali's Correct Data
```
Shefali shared once via WhatsApp:
  totalShares = 1
  coinsFromShares = 1 × 3 = 3

No one registered yet:
  totalReferrals = 0
  coinsFromReferrals = 0 × 1 = 0

TOTAL COINS = 3 + 0 = 3 ✅

Frontend displays:
  💰 Coin Breakdown
  - Coins from Shares: 3 coins (1 share × 3)
  - Coins from Referrals: 0 coins (0 registrations × 1)
  - Total Coins Earned: 3 coins ✅
```
