## 🔧 Issues Fixed

### 1. Navigate Import Error ❌ → ✅ FIXED

**Problem:**
- Console error: `ReferenceError: Navigate is not defined`
- Hot module reload (HMR) was failing
- Application wouldn't load properly

**Root Cause:**
- `Navigate` component from `react-router-dom` was imported but never used in `App.js`
- Custom `Redirect` component was used instead
- HMR cached the old import causing errors

**Solution:**
```javascript
// Before (Line 2 of App.js)
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Routes, Route, useNavigate, Navigate } from "react-router-dom";

// After
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Routes, Route, useNavigate } from "react-router-dom";
```

**Files Modified:**
- `frontend/src/App.js` - Removed unused Navigate import

**Status:** ✅ FIXED - Application now loads without errors
