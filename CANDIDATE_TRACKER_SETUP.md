    - Job details (title, company, location, salary range)
    - Match scores (education, skills, experience)
    - Application status and tracking history
  - Fallback logic to find jobs by email if recruiter_id doesn't match directly

#### PUT `/api/recruiters/applications/<application_id>/status`
- **Purpose:** Update the status of an application
- **Authentication:** Requires JWT token
- **Features:**

## Testing

### Quick Test:
```bash
# Run the test script
cd backend
python test_recruiter_applications.py
```

### Manual Test via Browser:
1. Start backend: `cd backend && python start_backend.py`
2. Start frontend: `cd frontend && npm start`
3. Log in as a recruiter
4. Navigate to Candidate Tracker
5. Verify applications are displayed

### API Test via cURL:
```bash
# Get applications (replace <TOKEN> with your JWT token)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>" http://localhost:3002/api/recruiters/applications

# Update application status
curl -X PUT \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"status": "reviewing"}' \
  http://localhost:3002/api/recruiters/applications/<application_id>/status
```

## Current Database Status
- **Jobs:** 5 jobs in database
- **Applications:** 15 applications in database
- All applications should be visible to their respective recruiters

## Status Values
The following status values are supported:
- `pending` - Initial state when application is submitted
- `ai_screening` - Application is being evaluated by AI
- `reviewing` - Under manual review by recruiter
- `shortlisted` - Selected for further consideration
- `interview` - Interview scheduled/in progress
- `offered` - Job offer extended
- `hired` - Candidate accepted and hired
- `rejected` - Application rejected

## Email Notifications
When a recruiter updates an application status:
- Candidate receives an email notification
- For interview status: includes interview date, mode, and notes
- For other statuses: includes status update and optional notes

## Troubleshooting

### No applications showing:
1. Check if recruiter has posted jobs
2. Check if candidates have applied to those jobs
3. Verify `recruiter_id` in jobs collection matches logged-in user ID
4. Check browser console for API errors

### Status update not working:
1. Verify JWT token is valid
2. Check if recruiter owns the job posting
3. Check backend console for error messages
4. Verify MongoDB connection is active

## Future Enhancements (Optional)
- Bulk status updates
- Export applications to CSV
- Advanced filtering (date range, score range)
- Candidate comparison view
- Interview scheduling calendar integration
- Notes/comments on applications
- File attachments (offer letters, etc.)
