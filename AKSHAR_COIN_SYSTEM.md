## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- If persists, log out and log back in

**Issue: Can't redeem coins**
- Check if you have sufficient balance
- Ensure you're logged in
- Try refreshing the page

**Issue: Coins not awarded after promo code use**
- Coins are awarded to the promo code owner, not the user
- Check transaction history for confirmation
- May take a few seconds to reflect

---

## üîê Security Considerations

1. **JWT Authentication:** All coin operations require valid authentication
2. **Server-side Validation:** All coin transactions validated on backend
3. **Transaction Logging:** Every coin transaction is logged for audit
4. **Balance Checks:** Insufficient balance prevents redemption
5. **Rate Limiting:** (Future) Prevent abuse through rate limiting

---

## üìà Analytics & Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Track
- Total coins in circulation
- Average coins per user
- Most popular redemption options
- Coin earning patterns
