# Role-Based Routing Setup

## Overview
Implemented proper role-based routing system that automatically directs users to their respective dashboards based on their role and profile completion status.

## Routing Flow

### 1. **New User Signup Flow**

#### Job Seeker:
```
Signup → Job Seeker Registration Form → Job Seeker Dashboard
```
- User signs up as "Job Seeker"
- Redirected to `/jobseeker-registration` to complete profile
- After profile completion, redirected to `/jobseeker-dashboard`

#### Recruiter:
```
Signup → Recruiter Registration Form → Recruiter Dashboard
```
- User signs up as "Recruiter"
- Redirected to `/recruiter-registration` to complete profile
- After profile completion, redirected to `/recruiter-dashboard`

#### Intern:
```
Signup → Intern Dashboard
```
- User signs up as "Intern"
- Directly redirected to `/intern-dashboard`

### 2. **Login Flow**

When a user logs in, the system checks:
1. **User Role** (jobSeeker, recruiter, intern, admin)
2. **Profile Completion Status** (`profileCompleted` or `hasCompletedProfile`)

#### Routing Logic:
- **Admin** → `/admin`
- **Recruiter** (profile incomplete) → `/recruiter-registration`
- **Recruiter** (profile complete) → `/recruiter-dashboard`
- **Job Seeker** (profile incomplete) → `/jobseeker-registration`
- **Job Seeker** (profile complete) → `/jobseeker-dashboard`
- **Intern** → `/intern-dashboard`

### 3. **Dashboard Route (`/dashboard`)**

The `/dashboard` route now uses a smart redirect component that:
- Checks if user is authenticated
- Determines user's role
- Checks profile completion status
- Redirects to appropriate destination

## Components Modified

### 1. **App.js**
- Added `DashboardRedirect` component for smart routing
- Updated `/dashboard` route to use `DashboardRedirect`
- Maintains existing role-specific dashboard routes

### 2. **AuthContext.jsx**
- Enhanced `login()` function to check profile completion
- Automatically redirects to registration forms if profile is incomplete
- Redirects to respective dashboards if profile is complete

### 3. **JobSeekerRegistrationFormComprehensive.jsx**
- Updated to redirect to `/jobseeker-dashboard` after successful profile completion
- Shows success message before redirect

### 4. **RecruiterRegistrationForm.jsx**
- Already configured to redirect to `/recruiter-dashboard` after completion

## Routes Summary

### Public Routes
- `/` - Home page
- `/signup` - Signup page
- `/login` - Login page
- `/public-jobs` - Public job listings

### Authentication Routes
- `/dashboard` - Smart redirect based on role and profile status

### Role-Specific Dashboards
- `/jobseeker-dashboard` - Job Seeker Dashboard (protected)
- `/recruiter-dashboard` - Recruiter Dashboard (protected)
- `/intern-dashboard` - Intern Dashboard (protected)
- `/admin` - Admin Dashboard (protected)

### Registration/Profile Completion
- `/jobseeker-registration` - Job Seeker profile completion form
- `/recruiter-registration` - Recruiter profile completion form

## Key Features

1. **Automatic Role Detection**: System automatically detects user role on login
2. **Profile Completion Check**: Verifies if user has completed their profile
3. **Smart Redirects**: Routes users to appropriate pages based on their status
4. **Protected Routes**: All dashboards are protected and require authentication
5. **Seamless Flow**: Users experience smooth transitions from signup → registration → dashboard

## Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: New Job Seeker
1. User signs up as Job Seeker
2. Redirected to Job Seeker Registration Form
3. Completes profile
4. Redirected to Job Seeker Dashboard
5. On future logins, goes directly to Job Seeker Dashboard

### Scenario 2: New Recruiter
1. User signs up as Recruiter
2. Redirected to Recruiter Registration Form
3. Completes profile
4. Redirected to Recruiter Dashboard
5. On future logins, goes directly to Recruiter Dashboard

### Scenario 3: Existing User Login
1. User logs in
2. System checks role and profile status
3. If profile incomplete: redirected to registration form
4. If profile complete: redirected to respective dashboard

### Scenario 4: Direct Dashboard Access
1. User navigates to `/dashboard`
2. `DashboardRedirect` component checks authentication
3. Routes to appropriate dashboard based on role
4. If profile incomplete, routes to registration form first

## Benefits

1. **User Experience**: Smooth, intuitive flow from signup to dashboard
2. **Security**: All routes are properly protected
3. **Maintainability**: Centralized routing logic in AuthContext and DashboardRedirect
4. **Flexibility**: Easy to add new roles or modify routing logic
5. **Consistency**: Same routing behavior across login, signup, and direct navigation
