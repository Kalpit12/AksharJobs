### Best Practices Implemented:

1. **One Component = One CSS File**
   - Each component should import ONLY its own CSS file
   - No multiple theme files

2. **No Override Files**
   - Don't create "override" or "improved" versions
   - Update the main file instead

3. **Naming Convention**
   - ComponentName.jsx → ComponentName.css
   - Clear, direct mapping

4. **Delete Old Files**
   - When creating new versions, delete old ones
   - Don't leave "_old" or "_improved" files
