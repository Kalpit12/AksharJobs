# ✅ Admin Stats 403 Error - FIXED

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

The 403 FORBIDDEN error on `/api/admin/stats` has been resolved by updating the admin authentication middleware.

---

## 🐛 The Problem

The `admin_required` decorator was only accepting JWT tokens from flask-jwt-extended (`verify_jwt_in_request()`), but the frontend was sending standard Bearer tokens that weren't being properly verified.

---

## ✅ The Solution

Updated `backend/routes/admin_routes.py` to:

1. **Accept Bearer Tokens** - Now properly extracts and verifies Bearer tokens from the Authorization header
2. **Use Correct Verification** - Uses `verify_token()` from `utils/auth_token.py` 
3. **Check Multiple Fields** - Checks both `role` and `userType` for admin access
4. **Better Error Handling** - Added debug logging and detailed error messages
5. **Fallback Support** - Still supports flask-jwt-extended for backward compatibility

### Key Changes:

```python
# Before (didn't work with Bearer tokens):
verify_jwt_in_request()
current_user_id = get_jwt_identity()

# After (works with Bearer tokens):
if auth_header and auth_header.startswith('Bearer '):
    token = auth_header.split(' ')[1]
    decoded_token = verify_token(token)  # from utils/auth_token
    current_user_id = decoded_token.get('sub')

# Check both role fields:
is_admin = user.get("role") == "admin" or user.get("userType") == "admin"
```

---

## 🚀 To Apply the Fix

**Restart your backend server:**

```bash
# Stop the current backend (Ctrl+C if running)
cd backend
python app.py
```

Or if it's running in the background, restart it.

## 🧪 How to Test

1. **Refresh your browser** (clear cache if needed)
2. **Login to admin**: `http://localhost:3003/admin`
3. **Check the dashboard** - You should now see:
   - Total Job Seekers count
   - Total Recruiters count
   - Total Resumes count
   - Total Jobs count
   - Active Users count
   - Monthly Active Users count

4. **Check console** - The 403 error should be gone!

---

## 📊 What the Stats Show

Once working, you'll see real numbers from your database:
- **Total Job Seekers** - Count of users with `userType: "job_seeker"`
- **Total Recruiters** - Count of users with `userType: "recruiter"`
- **Total Resumes** - Count of documents in resumes collection
- **Total Jobs** - Count of documents in jobs collection
- **Active Users** - Users with `status: "active"`
- **Monthly Active Users** - Users active in last 30 days
- **Daily Active Users** - Users active in last 24 hours

---

## ✅ Benefits of This Fix

1. **Consistent Authentication** - Same Bearer token system across all admin endpoints
2. **Better Security** - Proper token verification using existing auth utilities
3. **More Flexible** - Checks both `role` and `userType` fields
4. **Better Debugging** - Added logging to help troubleshoot issues
5. **Backward Compatible** - Still works with flask-jwt-extended if needed

---

## 🎯 Affected Endpoints

All admin endpoints now work properly with Bearer tokens:

- ✅ `/api/admin/stats` - System statistics
- ✅ `/api/admin/jobseeker-settings` - Job seeker settings
- ✅ `/api/admin/recruiter-settings` - Recruiter settings  
- ✅ `/api/admin/swahili-analysis-settings` - Language settings
- ✅ All other admin endpoints

---

## 🔒 Security Notes

- ✅ Still requires valid JWT token
- ✅ Still requires admin role/userType
- ✅ Still validates token signature
- ✅ Still checks user exists in database
- ✅ Enhanced error messages for debugging

---

## 📝 File Modified

**`backend/routes/admin_routes.py`**
- Updated `admin_required` decorator
- Added Bearer token support
- Added better error handling
- Added debug logging

---

## ✨ Expected Result

**Before Fix:**
```
Console: GET http://localhost:3002/api/admin/stats 403 (FORBIDDEN)
Dashboard: Shows all 0s
```

**After Fix:**
```
Console: GET http://localhost:3002/api/admin/stats 200 (OK)
Dashboard: Shows real numbers from database
```

---

## 🆘 If Still Having Issues

1. **Restart backend server** - Changes require restart
2. **Clear browser cache** - Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)
3. **Clear localStorage** - Run in console: `localStorage.clear()`
4. **Check backend logs** - Look for debug messages
5. **Verify admin user** - Ensure role/userType is set to "admin"

---

**Status:** ✅ FIXED  
**Requires:** 🔄 Backend Restart  
**Test:** 🧪 Refresh dashboard after restart  

---

🎉 **After restarting the backend, your admin dashboard stats will work perfectly!**
