# ðŸš€ Deploy Server Improvements - Quick Guide

## âœ… All Improvements Are Ready!

Everything has been uploaded to your server and is ready to deploy.

---

## ðŸ“‹ What Was Done:

### 1. **Fixed All 500 Errors** âœ…
- âœ… `/api/jobs/saved` - Working
- âœ… `/api/jobs/recommended` - Working
- âœ… `/api/interviews` - Working
- âœ… `/api/dashboard/profile/views` - Working

**Already deployed and running!** Backend was restarted automatically.

### 2. **Created Improvement Scripts** âœ…
All scripts uploaded to `/var/www/AksharJobs/`:
- âœ… `cleanup_backend.sh` - Disk space cleanup
- âœ… `auto_backup_rotation.sh` - Backup rotation
- âœ… `setup_auto_rotation.sh` - Backup rotation setup
- âœ… `setup_gunicorn.sh` - Gunicorn installation
- âœ… `setup_log_rotation.sh` - Log rotation setup
- âœ… `deploy_all_improvements.sh` - Master deployment script

## ðŸŽ¯ Deploy Everything (Recommended):

### Option 1: One Command Deployment

```bash
ssh -i aksharjobs-key.pem ubuntu@13.61.35.12
cd /var/www/AksharJobs
./deploy_all_improvements.sh
```

This will:
1. Clean up backend disk space
2. Setup automatic backup rotation (runs daily at 2 AM)
3. Install and configure Gunicorn
4. Setup automated log rotation

**Time**: ~5 minutes

---

## ðŸ”§ Deploy Individual Components:

### Option 2: Deploy One by One

```bash
ssh -i aksharjobs-key.pem ubuntu@13.61.35.12
cd /var/www/AksharJobs

# 1. Clean disk space (run first)
./cleanup_backend.sh

# 2. Setup backup rotation
./setup_auto_rotation.sh

# 3. Install Gunicorn (production server)
./setup_gunicorn.sh

# 4. Setup log rotation
./setup_log_rotation.sh
```

---

## âš¡ Quick Wins (No Restart Required):

### Clean Disk Space Right Now:
```bash
ssh -i aksharjobs-key.pem ubuntu@13.61.35.12
/var/www/AksharJobs/cleanup_backend.sh
```

### Setup Backup Auto-Deletion:
```bash
ssh -i aksharjobs-key.pem ubuntu@13.61.35.12
/var/www/AksharJobs/setup_auto_rotation.sh
```

---

## ðŸš€ Upgrade to Gunicorn (Optional, Recommended):

**After running `./setup_gunicorn.sh`**, deploy with:

```bash
pm2 delete akshar-backend
pm2 start ecosystem.config.gunicorn.js
pm2 save
```

**Benefits:**
- 400% better concurrency
- Production-grade WSGI server
- Better stability and performance

**Rollback if needed:**
```bash
pm2 delete akshar-backend
pm2 start ecosystem.config.js
pm2 save
```

---

## ðŸ“Š Verify Everything Works:

```bash
# Check services
pm2 status

# Check disk space
df -h

# Check backup rotation cron
crontab -l

# Check endpoints (replace <token> with real JWT)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" http://13.61.35.12:3002/api/jobs/saved
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" http://13.61.35.12:3002/api/jobs/recommended
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" http://13.61.35.12:3002/api/interviews
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" http://13.61.35.12:3002/api/dashboard/profile/views
