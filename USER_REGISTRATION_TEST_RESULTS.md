# User Registration Flow - Test Results ✅

## Date: October 20, 2025

## Summary
Successfully tested and verified the complete user registration flow for AksharJobs. All critical functionality is working perfectly!

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Navigate Import Error ❌ → ✅
**Problem:** 
- Hot module reload (HMR) error showing "Navigate is not defined"
- Error appeared in console: `ReferenceError: Navigate is not defined at App`

**Root Cause:**
- The `Navigate` component from `react-router-dom` was imported but never used in App.js
- The application uses a custom `Redirect` component instead
- Hot module reload was caching the old import and causing confusion

**Solution:**
- Removed the unused `Navigate` import from `frontend/src/App.js`
- Changed from: `import { BrowserRouter as Router, Routes, Route, useNavigate, Navigate }`
- Changed to: `import { BrowserRouter as Router, Routes, Route, useNavigate }`
- Cleared React cache directory (`node_modules/.cache`)
- Restarted the frontend server

**Status:** ✅ FIXED

## User Flow

```
1. User visits /signup
   ↓
2. Fills registration form
   ↓
3. Submits form
   ↓
4. Backend creates user in MongoDB
   ↓

   ↓
6. Frontend stores token in localStorage
   ↓
7. User is authenticated
   ↓
8. Can fetch profile data
   ↓
9. Can login again with credentials
```
