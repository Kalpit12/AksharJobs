### 3. Job Seeker Dashboard - Removed Resume Upload ✅
**File:** `frontend/src/pages/JobSeekerDashboard.jsx`

- **Removed:** "Upload Resume" button from profile completion section
- **Removed:** "Upload Your Resume" tip card from career tips section
- **Result:** Users no longer see resume upload prompts

### 4. Backend - No Changes Required ✅
**File:** `backend/routes/recruiter_routes.py`

- Match score fields are still returned by the API
- Frontend simply doesn't display them
- This allows easy re-enabling if needed in the future

## User Impact

### For Recruiters:
- ✅ Cleaner interface without unused "Recruitment Pipeline" menu item
- ✅ Candidate Tracker shows essential info only:
  - Candidate name and email
  - Job applied for
  - Application date
  - Current status
  - Cover letter
  - Timeline history
- ✅ Can still update application status
- ✅ Status updates still send email notifications

### For Job Seekers:
- ✅ No more resume upload prompts
- ✅ Profile completion focuses on filling out information
- ✅ Can still apply for jobs
- ✅ Can still view application status

## Technical Details

### What Was NOT Removed:
1. Backend match score calculation - still happens, just not displayed
2. Resume upload component file - exists but not imported anywhere
3. Application tracking system - fully functional
4. Email notifications - working perfectly

### Data Flow (Unchanged):
1. Applications are stored with all fields
2. Backend enriches with candidate/job details
3. Frontend receives full data
4. Frontend selectively displays relevant fields

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Candidate Tracker displays applications
- [x] Match scores not visible in Candidate Tracker
- [x] Application status updates work
- [x] Job Seeker Dashboard loads without errors

## Files Modified

1. `frontend/src/pages/RecruiterDashboard.jsx` - Removed pipeline nav and section
2. `frontend/src/components/RecruiterCandidateTracker.jsx` - Removed match scores display
3. `frontend/src/pages/JobSeekerDashboard.jsx` - Removed resume upload prompts

## Files Not Modified (Intentionally)

- `backend/routes/recruiter_routes.py` - API still returns all data
- `frontend/src/components/ResumeUpload.jsx` - Component exists but unused
- Database schema - Applications still store match scores

## Future Considerations

If match scores or resume upload need to be re-enabled:
1. All backend functionality is intact
2. Frontend just needs to uncomment/re-add display components
3. No database migrations required
