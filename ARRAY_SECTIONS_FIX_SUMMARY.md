# Array Sections Field Mapping Fixes

## ✅ Experience Section - FIXED!

### Changes Made:
- ✅ `exp.positionTitle` → `exp.title`
- ✅ `exp.responsibilities` → `exp.description`
- ✅ `exp.experienceType` → `exp.internshipType`
- ✅ `exp.duration` → `exp.startDate` and `exp.endDate` (separate month inputs)

**Result:** Experience should now show all data!

## ⏳ Projects Section - NEEDS FIX

**Database has:**
```javascript
{
  title: "E-Commerce Platform",
  description: "Built...",
  technologies: "React, Node.js...",
  role: "Full-Stack Developer",
  startDate: "2023-09",
  endDate: "2023-12",
  url: "https://github.com/...",
  category: "Web Development"
}
```

**Frontend likely looking for:** Need to check but probably same fields

---

## ⏳ Activities Section - NEEDS FIX

**Database has:**
```javascript
{
  name: "Women in Tech Club",
  role: "President",
  organization: "Stanford University",
  startDate: "2022-09",
  endDate: "2024-05",
  currentlyActive: "Yes",
  description: "Lead..."
}
```

**Frontend likely looking for:** Possibly "duration" instead of startDate/endDate

---

## ⏳ Certifications Section - NEEDS FIX

**Database has:**
```javascript
{
  name: "AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner",
  issuer: "Amazon Web Services",
  issueDate: "2023-06",
  expiryDate: "2026-06",
  credentialId: "AWS-123456",  ← This one is showing!
  url: "https://aws.amazon.com/certification"
}
```

**Frontend likely looking for:** "certificationName" instead of "name"?

---

## ⏳ References Section - NEEDS FIX

**Database has:**
```javascript
{
  name: "Dr. Sarah Chen",
  relationship: "Professor & Academic Advisor",
  organization: "Stanford University",
  email: "sarah.chen@stanford.edu",
  phone: "+1234567892",
  knownSince: "2020"
}
```

**Frontend likely looking for:** "title" instead of "relationship"?
