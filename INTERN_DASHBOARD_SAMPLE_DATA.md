## üêõ Troubleshooting

### If Login Fails (401 Error)
**This is good!** It means the password security fix is working. Make sure you use:
- Email: `intern.test@example.com`
- Password: `Intern@123` (case-sensitive)

### If No Internships Show
Check that:
1. Backend is running on port 5000
2. Jobs were created with `test_data: true` flag
3. Frontend is calling the correct API endpoint

### If Applications Don't Load
Verify:
1. User ID matches in applications
2. Application tracker endpoint is accessible
3. Token is being sent in request headers

## üìù Notes

- All sample data is marked with `test_data: true` for easy cleanup
- Password is properly hashed with bcrypt (security fix applied)
- Profile completion is dynamically calculated based on filled fields
- Internships are filtered to show only internship-type positions
- All dates are realistic (posted within last 10 days, deadlines 15-35 days ahead)

## üßπ Cleanup (Optional)

To remove all test data later:

```python
# In Python console or script
from utils.db import get_db

db = get_db()

# Delete test user
db.users.delete_one({"email": "intern.test@example.com"})

# Delete test internships
db.jobs.delete_many({"test_data": True})

# Delete test applications
db.applications.delete_many({"test_data": True})
