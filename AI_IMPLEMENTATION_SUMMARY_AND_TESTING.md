## 🚨 CURRENT ISSUE: MongoDB Not Running

### The Error
```
[ERROR] Error connecting to MongoDB: localhost:27017
No connection could be made because the target machine actively refused it
```

### The Solution

**You need to start MongoDB first!**

### Option 1: Start MongoDB Service (Windows)

```bash
# Open Command Prompt as Administrator
net start MongoDB
```

### Option 2: Start MongoDB Manually

```bash
# Navigate to MongoDB installation
cd "C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\7.0\bin"

# Start MongoDB
mongod --dbpath "C:\data\db"
```

### Option 3: Use Docker (Easiest!)

```bash
# Pull and run MongoDB
docker run -d -p 27017:27017 --name mongodb mongo:latest

# Verify it's running
docker ps
```

### Option 4: MongoDB Atlas (Cloud - No Installation)

1. Go to https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/register
2. Create free account
3. Create free cluster (M0)
4. Get connection string
5. Update `backend/config.py` or `backend/utils/db.py`
