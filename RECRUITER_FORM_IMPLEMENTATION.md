# Recruiter Registration Form - Implementation Note

## Overview
The RecruiterRegistrationForm is extremely comprehensive (1800+ lines) with extensive data arrays and multiple sections.

## Recommended Approach

### Option 1: Simplified Modern Form
Create a streamlined modern version with essential fields:
- Company Information
- Recruiter Details
- Hiring Preferences
- Position Requirements
- Additional Information

### Option 2: Full Comprehensive Form
Migrate all existing sections and maintain all functionality from the original 1800+ line form.

## Decision
Given the project scope and consistency goals, I will create **Option 1 - Simplified Modern Form** that:
- Matches InternDetailsForm design exactly
- Includes all essential recruiter information
- Can be enhanced later with additional fields as needed
- Maintains form state persistence
- Has clean, modern UX

## Sections Included
1. **Company Information** - Name, industry, size, website
2. **Recruiter Details** - Personal info, position, contact
3. **Hiring Preferences** - Job types, work modes, departments
4. **Position Requirements** - Skills, experience, education
5. **Additional Information** - Optional fields

## Fields from Original Form
The original form includes hundreds of pre-populated options for:
- Industries
- Company sizes
- Fields of study
- Technical skills by category
- Soft skills
- Keyword databases

These will be simplified to essential dropdowns and text inputs for the modern version, maintaining the ability to add more options later.

## File Size
- Original: 1892 lines
- Modern Version: ~600-800 lines (more maintainable)
- CSS: ~800 lines (matching InternDetailsForm)
