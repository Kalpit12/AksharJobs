# Git LFS Setup for Large Files

Your AksharJobs project has a large ML model file that GitHub recommends tracking with Git LFS (Large File Storage).

## Current Warning

```
File fine_tuned_sbert/model.safetensors is 86.65 MB
This is larger than GitHub's recommended maximum file size of 50.00 MB
```

## ✅ Current Status

Your push was **successful**. The warning is just a recommendation. The file is in your repository and works fine.

## Options

### Option 1: Do Nothing ⭐ (Recommended if working)

**Pros:**
- Already working
- No additional setup
- File is accessible to all cloners

**Cons:**
- Warning on every push
- Slower clone times
- Counts toward repository size

**Action:** None needed!

---

### Option 2: Add to .gitignore (Simplest Fix)

If the model can be regenerated or downloaded separately:

**Steps:**

1. Add to `.gitignore`:
   ```bash
   echo "fine_tuned_sbert/" >> .gitignore
   ```

2. Remove from repository (keeps local copy):
   ```bash
   git rm -r --cached fine_tuned_sbert/
   git commit -m "Remove large ML model from repository"
   git push
   ```

3. Add download instructions to README

**Pros:**
- Removes warning
- Smaller repository
- Faster clones

**Cons:**
- Users need to download model separately
- Extra setup step

---

### Option 3: Use Git LFS (Best Practice)

Git LFS (Large File Storage) is designed for large files like ML models.

**Steps:**

#### 1. Install Git LFS

**Windows:**
```powershell
# Download from https://git-lfs.github.com/
# Or use Chocolatey:
choco install git-lfs
```

**Mac:**
```bash
brew install git-lfs
```

**Linux:**
```bash
sudo apt-get install git-lfs
```

#### 2. Initialize Git LFS

```bash
git lfs install
```

#### 3. Track the large file

```bash
git lfs track "fine_tuned_sbert/*.safetensors"
```

This creates/updates `.gitattributes`

#### 4. Add .gitattributes to repository

```bash
git add .gitattributes
git commit -m "Track ML model with Git LFS"
```

#### 5. Migrate existing file

```bash
# This rewrites history - backup first!
git lfs migrate import --include="fine_tuned_sbert/model.safetensors"
git push --force
```

**Pros:**
- Designed for large files
- GitHub optimized
- Faster clones
- No warnings

**Cons:**
- Requires Git LFS installation
- Force push needed (rewrites history)
- Extra setup for contributors

## 📊 File Size Analysis

Your large files:
```
fine_tuned_sbert/model.safetensors: 86.65 MB
```

**GitHub Limits:**
- Soft limit (warning): 50 MB
- Hard limit (reject): 100 MB
- With Git LFS: Up to 2 GB per file

---

## 💡 Recommendation

**For Your Use Case:**

### If this is for development/learning: ✅ Option 1 (Do Nothing)
- It works
- Warning is harmless
- Everyone gets the model automatically

### If you plan to have many contributors: Option 2 (Gitignore)
- Provide model download link
- Smaller repo
- Faster for contributors

### If this is a production project: Option 3 (Git LFS)
- Professional approach
- Best practice for ML models
- Scalable solution

## 📝 Next Steps

### Immediate (Optional)

1. **Visit your repository:**
   ```
   https://github.com/Kalpit12/AksharJobs
   ```

2. **Check if everything looks good**
   - README displays properly
   - Folder structure correct
   - No sensitive data visible

3. **If you see the warning bothers you:**
   - Choose an option above
   - Otherwise, ignore it!

### Future Updates

## 🎓 About the ML Model

The `fine_tuned_sbert` model is a fine-tuned Sentence-BERT model for:
- Resume matching
- Job description analysis
- Skill extraction

**Size:** 86.65 MB  
**Type:** `.safetensors` (PyTorch model)

**Alternatives to storing in Git:**
1. **Download on deployment** - Fetch from Google Drive/S3
2. **Use Hugging Face** - Host model on Hugging Face Hub
3. **Include in Docker image** - Keep out of Git
4. **Git LFS** - Track with Git LFS

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### If you want to remove the file now:

```bash
# Remove from Git but keep locally
git rm --cached fine_tuned_sbert/model.safetensors

# Add to .gitignore
echo "fine_tuned_sbert/*.safetensors" >> .gitignore

# Commit
git add .gitignore
git commit -m "Remove large ML model from Git tracking"
git push
```

Then provide download instructions for the model.

## ✅ Summary

**Current Status:** ✅ Everything working  
**Warning Impact:** ⚠️ Cosmetic only  
**Action Required:** ❌ None (optional improvements available)  

**Your repository is ready to use!** 🎉
