# Profile Field Persistence Fix Applied ✅

## 🐛 **Issue Identified**
From the logs, the problem was clear:
- **Save**: Blood Group was being saved correctly to database ✅
- **Load**: Blood Group was returning as `None` ❌

## 🔍 **Root Cause**
The issue was in `backend/routes/jobseeker_registration_routes.py`. When a user's profile is not found in the `jobseeker_profiles` collection, the code creates a fallback structure from the `users` collection. However, the flattened profile response was only checking the nested structure and not the direct user fields.

## 🛠️ **Fix Applied**

### **Before (Broken)**:
```python
'bloodGroup': profile.get('additionalInfo', {}).get('bloodGroup'),
'workPermit': profile.get('nationalityResidency', {}).get('workPermit'),
```

### **After (Fixed)**:
```python
'bloodGroup': profile.get('additionalInfo', {}).get('bloodGroup') or profile.get('bloodGroup'),
'workPermit': profile.get('nationalityResidency', {}).get('workPermit') or profile.get('workPermit'),
```

## 🧪 **Testing Instructions**

### **Test Blood Group & Work Permit**:
1. Navigate to MyProfile page
2. Edit Demographics section → Change Blood Group to "B+"
3. Edit Nationality & Residency section → Change Work Permit to "Permanent Resident"
4. Click Save on both sections
5. **Refresh page (F5)**
6. **Verify**: Both fields should show saved values, not blank

### **Expected Backend Logs**:
```
🩸 Blood Group in request: B+
✅ Verified in DB - Blood Group: B+
🩸 Returning Blood Group: B+  ← Should NOT be None anymore
```

## 🎯 **Expected Results**

### **Before Fix**:
- Blood Group: `None` ❌
- Work Permit: `None` ❌

### **After Fix**:
- Blood Group: `B+` ✅
- Work Permit: `permanent-resident` ✅

## 🔧 **How the Fix Works**

The fix uses the `or` operator to check both data sources:

```python
# This checks nested structure first, then falls back to direct user fields
'bloodGroup': profile.get('additionalInfo', {}).get('bloodGroup') or profile.get('bloodGroup')
```

**Data Flow**:
1. **Save**: MyProfile → `/api/profile/profile` → `users` collection
2. **Load**: MyProfile → `/api/jobseeker/profile` → `users` collection (fallback)
3. **Response**: Now properly returns direct user fields when nested structure doesn't exist

## 🚀 **Ready for Testing**

The fix is now applied. Please:

1. **Refresh the MyProfile page**
2. **Check if Blood Group shows "B+"**
3. **Check if Work Permit shows "Permanent Resident"**
4. **Try editing other fields and refreshing**
5. **All fields should now persist correctly!**

**Status**: ✅ **FIX APPLIED**
**Expected Result**: All profile fields should now persist after refresh
**Test Required**: Refresh page and verify Blood Group & Work Permit display correctly
