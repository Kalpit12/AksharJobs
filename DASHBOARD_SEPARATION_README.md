# Dashboard Separation Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation of proper separation between recruiter and job seeker dashboards in the RocketJobs application. The system now includes role-based access control, authentication guards, and proper user type management.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Authentication Context (`frontend/src/context/AuthContext.jsx`)
- **Centralized Authentication State**: Created a React context to manage user authentication state across the application
- **Role Management**: Implements role-based access control with methods like `isJobSeeker()`, `isRecruiter()`, and `isAdmin()`
- **Automatic Routing**: Automatically redirects users to appropriate dashboards based on their role after login
- **Token Management**: Handles JWT token storage and retrieval from localStorage

### 2. Protected Route Component (`frontend/src/components/ProtectedRoute.jsx`)
- **Route Guards**: Protects routes based on authentication status and user roles
- **Role Validation**: Ensures users can only access routes appropriate for their role
- **Automatic Redirects**: Redirects unauthorized users to appropriate dashboards or login page
- **Loading States**: Shows loading spinner while checking authentication status

### 3. Updated App.js Routing
- **Role-Specific Routes**: 
  - `/recruiter-dashboard` - Only accessible by recruiters
  - `/jobseeker-dashboard` - Only accessible by job seekers
  - `/admin` - Only accessible by administrators
- **Protected Routes**: All dashboard and profile routes are now protected
- **Authentication Wrapper**: Wrapped the entire app with `AuthProvider`

### 4. Enhanced Header Component (`frontend/src/components/Header.jsx`)
- **Dynamic Navigation**: Shows different navigation options based on user role
- **User Menu**: Displays user information and role-specific actions
- **Authentication Status**: Shows login/signup buttons for unauthenticated users
- **Role-Based Links**: 
  - Job Seekers see "Dashboard" link
  - Recruiters see "Recruiter Hub" link
  - Admins see "Admin" link

### 5. Updated Authentication Pages
- **LoginPage**: Now uses AuthContext for authentication and automatic role-based routing
- **SignupPage**: Integrated with AuthContext and improved form handling
- **Role Selection**: Users must choose their account type during registration

### 6. Dashboard Security
- **Component-Level Checks**: Both `JobSeekerDashboard` and `RecruiterDashboard` include authentication checks
- **Role Validation**: Dashboards verify user role before rendering content
- **Automatic Redirects**: Unauthorized users are redirected to appropriate pages

## Security Features

### 1. Route Protection
```javascript
// Example of protected route
<Route path="/recruiter-dashboard" element={
  <ProtectedRoute requiredRole="recruiter">
    <RecruiterDashboard />
  </ProtectedRoute>
} />
```

### 2. Role-Based Access Control
```javascript
// Check user role
if (user?.role === 'recruiter') {
  // Show recruiter-specific content
} else if (user?.role === 'jobSeeker') {
  // Show job seeker-specific content
}
```

### 3. Authentication Guards
```javascript
// Component-level authentication check
useEffect(() => {
  if (!isAuthenticated) {
    navigate('/login');
    return;
  }
  
  if (!isRecruiter) {
    navigate('/');
    return;
  }
}, [isAuthenticated, isRecruiter, navigate]);
```

## User Flow

### 1. Registration Flow
1. User visits `/signup`
2. Selects account type (Job Seeker or Recruiter)
3. Fills in required information
4. Account is created
5. User is redirected to `/login`

### 2. Login Flow
1. User visits `/login`
2. Enters credentials
3. System validates credentials and retrieves user role
4. User is automatically redirected to appropriate dashboard:
   - Job Seekers → `/jobseeker-dashboard`
   - Recruiters → `/recruiter-dashboard`
   - Admins → `/admin`

### 3. Dashboard Access
1. **Job Seekers** can only access:
   - `/jobseeker-dashboard`
   - `/profile`
   - `/upload`
   - `/appliedjobs`
   - General job-related routes

2. **Recruiters** can only access:
   - `/recruiter-dashboard`
   - `/recruiterapplicants`
   - `/viewtopcandidates`
   - `/viewallcandidates`
   - `/cv-browser`
   - Recruiter-specific routes

3. **Admins** can access:
   - `/admin`
   - All routes in the system

## Error Handling

### 1. Unauthorized Access
- Users trying to access unauthorized routes are automatically redirected
- Role mismatch redirects users to their appropriate dashboard
- Unauthenticated users are redirected to login page

### 2. Authentication Failures
- Invalid tokens result in logout and redirect to login
- Expired tokens trigger automatic logout
- Network errors show appropriate error messages

## Testing the Implementation

### 1. Test Job Seeker Access
1. Create a job seeker account
2. Login with job seeker credentials
3. Verify access to `/jobseeker-dashboard`
4. Try accessing `/recruiter-dashboard` - should be redirected

### 2. Test Recruiter Access
1. Create a recruiter account
2. Login with recruiter credentials
3. Verify access to `/recruiter-dashboard`
4. Try accessing `/jobseeker-dashboard` - should be redirected

### 3. Test Unauthenticated Access
1. Clear localStorage or logout
2. Try accessing any dashboard route
3. Should be redirected to `/login`

## Future Enhancements

### 1. Session Management
- Implement session timeout
- Add "Remember Me" functionality
- Implement refresh token rotation

### 2. Advanced Role Management
- Support for multiple roles per user
- Role hierarchy and permissions
- Custom role creation for organizations

### 3. Audit Logging
- Track user access to different routes
- Log authentication attempts
- Monitor role changes

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Dashboard Not Loading**
   - Check if user is authenticated
   - Verify user role in localStorage
   - Check browser console for errors

2. **Redirect Loops**
   - Ensure proper role validation
   - Check authentication state management
   - Verify route protection logic

3. **Role Mismatch**
   - Clear localStorage and re-login
   - Verify backend role assignment
   - Check user registration flow

## Conclusion

The dashboard separation implementation provides:
- **Secure Access Control**: Users can only access appropriate dashboards
- **Role-Based Navigation**: UI adapts to user role
- **Automatic Routing**: Seamless user experience with proper redirects
- **Scalable Architecture**: Easy to add new roles and permissions

This implementation ensures that recruiters and job seekers have completely separate experiences while maintaining security and user experience standards.
