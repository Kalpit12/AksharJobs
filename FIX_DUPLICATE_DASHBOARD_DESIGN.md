# 🔧 Fix Duplicate Dashboard Design Issue

## 🐛 Problem

After login, the Job Seeker Dashboard shows **two different designs** or appears duplicated.

## 🔍 Root Causes

### 1. React StrictMode (Most Likely)
**Location**: `frontend/src/index.js` lines 35-37

React StrictMode causes components to render **TWICE** in development mode to detect side effects. This can cause visual duplication or flickering.

### 2. CSS Loading Timing
Multiple CSS files loading at different times can cause design shifts.

### 3. Component Re-mounting
If the component unmounts and remounts quickly, it can appear duplicated.

## ✅ Solutions

### Solution 1: Disable React StrictMode (Quick Fix)

Edit `frontend/src/index.js`:

**Before:**
```javascript
root.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>
);
```

**After:**
```javascript
root.render(
  <App />
);
```

### Solution 2: Add CSS Specificity

Ensure `JobSeekerDashboard.css` has highest specificity by adding `!important` where needed.

### Solution 3: Clear Browser Cache

Sometimes cached CSS causes issues:
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Right-click refresh button
3. Select "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"
4. Or use Incognito mode

### Solution 4: Add Key to Dashboard

Prevent re-mounting by adding a stable key prop.

## 🛠️ Implementation

I'll apply Solution 1 (remove StrictMode) as it's the most common cause.
