## 🐛 BUGS & ISSUES LOG

### Issue #1: Signup Form Field Mapping
**Severity:** Medium (Fixed)  
**Status:** RESOLVED ✅  

**Description:** Frontend was sending incorrect field names to backend API.

**Details:**
- Frontend sent: `phone` and `role`
- Backend expected: `phoneNumber` and `userType`
- Result: 400 Bad Request error

**Fix Applied:**
Updated `frontend/src/pages/Signup.jsx` line 127-134 to send correct field names.

```javascript
// Before (incorrect):
phone: formData.phone,
role: formData.role

// After (correct):
phoneNumber: formData.phone,
userType: formData.role
```

**Verification:** Fix validated via Python test script - user successfully created.

### Issue #2: Notification/Message API Timeouts
**Severity:** Low  
**Status:** OBSERVED (Not blocking core functionality)

**Description:** Notification and message count endpoints timing out.

**Impact:**
- Dashboard loading delayed
