# Field Mismatches Found - InternMyProfile.jsx

## Issue: Data exists but not displaying

**Root Cause:** Case sensitivity and field name mismatches between database and frontend

---

## Dropdown Value Mismatches (FIXED)

### 1. Preferred Locations Section
- ✅ `willingToRelocate`: Changed "yes" → "Yes"
- ✅ `internshipMode`: Changed "hybrid" → "Hybrid"

### 2. Internship Preferences Section  
- ✅ `internshipDuration`: Changed "4-6-months" → "3-6 months"
- ✅ `availability`: Changed "immediate" → "Immediate"
- ✅ `internshipTiming`: Added "Summer 2025" option
- ✅ `unpaidWilling`: Changed "yes"/"no" → "Yes"/"No"
- ✅ `academicCredit`: Changed "yes"/"no" → "Yes"/"No"

## Array Field Name Mismatches (TO FIX)

### 3. Education Section
**Database has:**
```javascript
{
  institution: "Stanford University",

  endDate: "2024-05",
  gpa: "3.8",
  currentlyStudying: "Yes",
  relevantCoursework: "Data Structures, Algorithms..."

- Missing: `startDate`, `endDate`, `currentlyStudying`, `relevantCoursework`
