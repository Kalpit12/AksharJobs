# ðŸš€ Start AI Features Testing - Quick Guide

## Issue
MongoDB is not running, which is required for the backend and AI features.

## Solution - Step by Step

### Step 1: Start MongoDB

**Option A - If you have MongoDB installed:**
```bash
# Start MongoDB service
net start MongoDB
```

**Option B - If MongoDB is not a service:**
```bash
# Navigate to MongoDB bin folder (usually):
cd "C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\[version]\bin"
mongod --dbpath "C:\data\db"
```

**Option C - Using Docker (recommended):**
```bash
docker run -d -p 27017:27017 --name mongodb mongo:latest
```

### Step 2: Verify MongoDB is Running

```bash
# Check if MongoDB is accessible
mongo --eval "db.version()"
# OR
mongosh --eval "db.version()"
```

### Step 3: Start Backend Server

```bash
cd backend
python app.py
```

You should see:
```
 * Running on http://localhost:3002
 * Connected to MongoDB successfully
```

### Step 4: Setup Test Accounts

```bash
# In a new terminal
cd backend
python setup_ai_test_accounts.py
```

### Step 5: Run AI Features Tests

```bash
cd backend
python test_ai_features_complete.py
```

### Step 6: Start Frontend (if needed)

```bash
# In another terminal
cd frontend
npm start
```

## Quick Test Without Backend

If you want to test the frontend UI without backend, the AI components will show errors but you can see the design:

1. Start frontend only: `cd frontend && npm start`
2. Login with any account
3. Navigate to dashboards to see AI component layouts
4. Click AI buttons (they will show errors but UI is visible)

## All Test Accounts

After running `setup_ai_test_accounts.py`:

**Job Seeker:**
- Email: jobseeker@test.com
- Password: Test123!@#

**Intern:**
- Email: intern@test.com  
- Password: Test123!@#

**Recruiter:**
- Email: recruiter@test.com
- Password: Test123!@#

## Troubleshooting

### "MongoDB connection refused"
**Fix:** Start MongoDB first (see Step 1 above)

### "Module not found" errors
**Fix:** 
```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### "Port already in use"
**Fix:** Kill the process on port 3002 or change port in config

### "No applications/candidates found"
**Fix:** Create test data by:
1. Login as job seeker
2. Apply to a job
3. Then test application review

## ðŸŽ¯ Quick Manual Test (No MongoDB)

Want to see the AI features UI without setting up MongoDB?

The components are already integrated! Just:

1. Check the component files in `frontend/src/components/AI*.jsx`
2. Review the beautiful UI designs
3. See the integration in dashboards
4. All styling is complete

The backend logic is ready - just needs MongoDB running to store data!
