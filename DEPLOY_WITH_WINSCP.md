# Deploy JobSeeker Dashboard Using WinSCP (Easiest Method)

## Why WinSCP?
Your SSH key (`C:\Users\kalpi\key.pem`) is having permission issues with Windows command-line SSH. WinSCP is a free GUI tool that handles this perfectly and is much easier to use.

   - You'll see a progress window
   - Should take 1-2 minutes depending on connection
   - When complete, the progress window will close

## ‚öôÔ∏è Step 5: Set Permissions and Reload Nginx

After files are uploaded, you need to set proper permissions and reload Nginx.

### Option A: Using WinSCP's built-in terminal
1. In WinSCP, press **`Ctrl+T`** to open terminal (or Commands ‚Üí Open Terminal)
2. In the terminal window, run these commands:

```bash
cd /var/www/AksharJobs/frontend/build
sudo chown -R ubuntu:www-data .
sudo chmod -R 755 .
sudo find . -type f -exec chmod 644 {} \;
sudo systemctl reload nginx
exit
```

### Option B: Using PuTTY
1. Download PuTTY: https://www.putty.org/
2. Open PuTTY
3. Load your saved session or enter:
   - Host: `13.61.35.12`
   - Port: `22`
   - Connection type: SSH
4. Under Connection ‚Üí SSH ‚Üí Auth ‚Üí Credentials:
   - Browse to your `key.pem` file (or the `.ppk` file WinSCP created)
5. Click "Open"
6. Login as: `ubuntu`
7. Run the commands above

### Option C: Use Windows Terminal with proper permissions
1. Open PowerShell as Administrator
2. Run:
```powershell
# Fix key permissions
icacls "C:\Users\kalpi\key.pem" /inheritance:r
icacls "C:\Users\kalpi\key.pem" /grant:r "$($env:USERNAME):(R)"

# Then SSH in
ssh -i "C:\Users\kalpi\key.pem" ubuntu@13.61.35.12

# On the server, run:
cd /var/www/AksharJobs/frontend/build
sudo chown -R ubuntu:www-data .
sudo chmod -R 755 .
sudo find . -type f -exec chmod 644 {} \;
sudo systemctl reload nginx
exit
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Problem: WinSCP can't convert the key
**Solution:** 
- Download PuTTYgen: https://www.puttygen.com/
- Open PuTTYgen
- Click "Load" ‚Üí select your `key.pem`
- Click "Save private key" ‚Üí save as `key.ppk`
- Use the `.ppk` file in WinSCP

### Problem: Can't see the dashboard after deployment
**Solution:**
1. Make sure you cleared browser cache
2. Try hard refresh: `Ctrl + F5`
3. Try in incognito/private browsing mode
4. Check browser console (F12) for errors

### Problem: Dashboard loads but looks broken
**Solution:**
1. Check if all files were uploaded (especially the `static` folder)
2. Verify file permissions were set correctly
3. Check Nginx error logs:
   ```bash
   ssh -i "C:\Users\kalpi\key.pem" ubuntu@13.61.35.12
   sudo tail -f /var/log/nginx/error.log
   ```

### Problem: "404 Not Found" on dashboard route
**Solution:**
1. Verify Nginx configuration has the correct `try_files` directive
2. SSH into server and check:
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
   # Should have: try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
   sudo nginx -t
   sudo systemctl reload nginx
   ```
