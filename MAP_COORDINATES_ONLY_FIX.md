# Map Coordinates Only Fix âœ…

## Issue Fixed
Users were getting auto-filled addresses when clicking on the map, which might not be accurate. Now the map only captures coordinates, and users must manually enter their address.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Job Seeker Registration Form** âœ…
**File:** `frontend/src/pages/JobSeekerRegistrationFormComprehensive.jsx`

**Before:**
```javascript
// Reverse geocode to get address
fetch(`https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/reverse?format=json&lat=${lat}&lon=${lng}`)
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => {
    if (data.display_name) {
      setFormData(prev => ({
        ...prev,
        address: data.display_name
      }));
    }
  })
```

**After:**
```javascript
// Note: Address is entered manually by user, not auto-filled from coordinates
```

### 2. **Intern Details Form** âœ…
**File:** `frontend/src/pages/InternDetailsForm.jsx`

Applied the same fix - removed reverse geocoding.

## How It Works Now

### âœ… **Map Functionality:**
- Users click on map â†’ **Only coordinates are captured**
- Coordinates display: `Lat: -1.270458, Lng: 36.854496`
- **Address field remains empty** for manual entry

### âœ… **User Experience:**
1. **Manual Address Entry:** Users type their exact address in the "Full Address" field
2. **Coordinate Capture:** Users click map to mark their precise location
3. **Data Storage:** Both address (manual) and coordinates (from map) are stored separately

### âœ… **Data Structure:**
```javascript
{
  address: "User manually typed address",        // Manual entry
  latitude: "-1.270458",                        // From map click
  longitude: "36.854496"                        // From map click
}
```

## Benefits
- âœ… **Accurate Addresses:** Users enter their exact, preferred address
- âœ… **Precise Coordinates:** Map provides exact GPS coordinates
- âœ… **Better Data Quality:** No reliance on potentially inaccurate reverse geocoding
- âœ… **User Control:** Users have full control over their address information

## Testing
1. Go to job seeker registration or intern form
2. Click on map â†’ Verify only coordinates update
3. Enter address manually â†’ Verify it doesn't get overwritten
4. Submit form â†’ Verify both address and coordinates are saved separately

**Perfect! Now users have full control over their address while getting precise coordinates from the map.** ðŸŽ¯
