# 🔄 Backend Restart Instructions - Debug Version

## 📋 What I've Added

Debug print statements to track if admin routes are being loaded:
- ✅ Print when `admin_routes.py` file is imported
- ✅ Print when Blueprint is created
- ✅ Print when Blueprint is registered in Flask app

---

## 🚀 Steps to Restart and Debug:

### 1. Stop the Backend Server
In your backend terminal, press `Ctrl+C` and wait for it to fully stop.

### 2. Restart the Backend
```bash
python app.py
```

### 3. Watch the Terminal Output

You should see these messages when starting:
```
🔵 Loading admin_routes.py...
✅ Admin routes Blueprint created
✅ Admin routes registered at /api/admin
```

**If you DON'T see these messages**, there's an import error.

---

## 🔍 What to Look For:

### ✅ Success Output:
```
🔵 Loading admin_routes.py...
✅ Admin routes Blueprint created
...
✅ Admin routes registered at /api/admin
...
 * Running on http://localhost:3002
```

### ❌ Error Output:
If you see any errors like:
- `ImportError`
- `ModuleNotFoundError`
- `SyntaxError`
- Red error text

**Copy the full error and share it!**

---

## 🧪 After Restart - Test Endpoints:

### Test 1: Simple Test Endpoint (No Auth Required)
```
http://localhost:3002/api/admin/test
```

**Expected:** 
```json
{"message": "Admin routes are working!"}
```

**If this works**, admin routes are registered! ✅

### Test 2: Stats Endpoint (Auth Required)
Then refresh your admin dashboard at:
```
http://localhost:3003/admin
```

**Expected:** Stats load without 404 error ✅

---

## 💡 Common Issues:

### Issue 1: Old Process Still Running
**Solution:**
```powershell
# Check for Python processes
tasklist | findstr python

# Kill the process
taskkill /F /PID <process_id>

# Restart
python app.py
```

### Issue 2: Import Error
If you see an import error, check:
- Is `backend/routes/admin_routes.py` file present?
- Does it have syntax errors?

### Issue 3: Port Already in Use
If you see "Address already in use":
- Another process is using port 3002
- Kill it or use a different port
